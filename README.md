# Scalable and Cost-effective Image Recognition App with AWS CDK and AI Rekognition

 #### A serverless architecture using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to analyze images for their content and create a database that can be queried using an API. The technologies used are AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Rekognition, Amazon API Gateway, Flask, Traefik, Docker, and HTMX.

* CDK: The AWS Cloud Development Kit is a framework for creating and managing AWS infrastructure using code.
* Lambda: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
* S3: Amazon S3 is a scalable object storage service that can be used to store images.
* DynamoDB: Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that can be used to store the metadata of the images.
* Rekognition: Amazon Rekognition is a machine learning service that can be used to analyze images and extract their content.
* API Gateway: Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that allows you to create, deploy, and manage RESTful APIs.
* Flask: Flask is a Python microframework that can be used to create web applications.
* Traefik: Traefik is a modern reverse proxy and load balancer that can be used to route traffic to the different components of the application.
* Docker: Docker is a containerization platform that can be used to package and deploy applications.
* HTMX: HTMX is a JavaScript library that can be used to create interactive web applications.
* Git is a version control system that can be used to track changes to code and other files.
* GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.
